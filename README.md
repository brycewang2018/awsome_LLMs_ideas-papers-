- This paper introduces the MultiMedQA benchmark to evaluate the performance of large language models in medical question answering. By introducing the new dataset HealthSearchQA and a human evaluation framework, the study shows that Flan-PaLM achieved leading accuracy across multiple datasets but highlights gaps in areas like comprehension and reasoning. It also proposes the instruction prompt tuning method to improve model performance in the medical domain.

## (AAAI 2023) Estimating Geographic Spillover Effects of COVID-19 Policies: From Large-Scale Mobility Networks
- Chang, S., Vrabac, D., Leskovec, J., & Ugander, J. (2023, June). Estimating geographic spillover effects of COVID-19 policies from large-scale mobility networks. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (Vol. 37, No. 12, pp. 14161-14169).
- https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/26657
- DOI: https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i12.26657
- This paper investigates the spillover effects of county-level mobility restrictions in California's COVID-19 policy, showing that local restrictions are only 54% as effective as statewide restrictions in reducing mobility. Using a regression discontinuity design, the study leverages mobility data to reveal significant cross-county movement, especially in sectors like retail and dining. The authors propose an optimized "macro-county" policy approach that achieves over 90% of the effectiveness of statewide restrictions by grouping counties to mitigate spillovers.

## LLMs generate structurally realistic social networks but overestimate political homophily
- Chang, S., Chaszczewicz, A., Wang, E., Josifovska, M., Pierson, E., & Leskovec, J. (2024). LLMs generate structurally realistic social networks but overestimate political homophily. arXiv preprint arXiv:2408.16629.
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16629
- This paper evaluates **LLM-generated social networks**, finding that "local" generation methods produce more realistic networks that align well with real-world characteristics like density and clustering. However, LLMs overestimate political homophily, placing more emphasis on political alignment than seen in actual social networks.

## Detecting Gang-Involved Escalation on Social Media Using Context
- Chang, S., Zhong, R., Adams, E., Lee, F. T., Varia, S., Patton, D., ... & McKeown, K. (2018). Detecting gang-involved escalation on social media using context. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.03632.
- https://aclanthology.org/D18-1005/
- This paper presents a system for detecting expressions of aggression and loss in social media posts by gang-involved youth, using domain-specific resources and contextual representations of usersâ€™ recent tweets and interactions. By incorporating context into a CNN model, the system achieves significantly improved accuracy in identifying potential risks of real-world violence.
